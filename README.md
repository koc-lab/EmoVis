# EmoVis

This is the GitHub repository for the paper: “ Emotion Classification with Visibility Graphs ” submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2024. In this study, we generate a visibility graph-based model, EmoVis, to perform emotion classification of the text data.

#### Graph Generation ####
For the implementation details of graph generation, refer to codes `graph_generation.py`. For the implementation details of data preprocessing, refer to codes `data_preprocessing.py`.

#### Model and Training ####
For the implementation details of the model used for training, refer to codes `model_train.py`
